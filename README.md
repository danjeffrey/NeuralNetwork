# A Simple neural network solver
### Objective: 
Provide a simple API for defining a neural network, feeding test data, telling it to learn its parameters, and then using it to generate proedictions for new data sets. 

This is a learning exercise and not intended to be a state of the art or commercial grade tool.  

Your contributions, input, and critiques are more than welcome.
